Lamposerveri:
Controls heating on my home: 
analysing temperatures and time of the day and other statistics to command relayServer via http
Tempertures measured with 1wire sensors (Dallas semiconductor DS1820) 

1wire:
buss is connected with USB and read with owfs (http://owfs.org/)

RelayServer:
Arduino Duemillanove connected to Relay module which has 14 Relays
Relays controls power on floor heating(Vesikierto, piiri säätimet jakotukissa) 

GET http://host.domain/rele/Relay No
GET http://host.domain/on/Relay No
GET http://host.domain/off/Relay No


simply :
to view relay 1 status (http://10.10.10.54/rele/1)
to switch on relay 1 (http://10.10.10.54/on/1)
to switch off relay 1 (http://10.10.10.54/off/1)

Lampo2Mongo:

Logs 1 wire temperature and other sensors status/state to Mongo database with pymongo.
