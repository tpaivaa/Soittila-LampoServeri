There is two relay cards controlled by Arduino
One is 4 relay card and second is 8 relay card.

Relaycard 1 controlled by Arduino Analog pins 5 to 2
Rele1 = Analog pin5 = Not In use
Rele2 = Analog pin4 = khh
Rele3 = Analog pin3 = Kitchen floor
Rele4 = Analog pin2 = Not In use

Relaycard2 controlled by analog pins 1 to 0 and digital pins 3 to 8
Rele5 = Analog pin1 = Not In use
Rele6 = Analog pin0 = Not In use
Rele7 = Digital pin 3 = Floor pump
Rele8 = Digital pin 4 = Main pump
Rele9 = Digital pin 5 = Not In use
ReleA = Digital pin 6 = Pesuhuone (upstairs)
ReleB = Digital pin 7 = Not In use
ReleC = Digital pin 8 = Attack Heating on/off
